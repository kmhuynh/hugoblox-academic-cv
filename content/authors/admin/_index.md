#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network‚Äôs architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I‚Äôm a postdoc in Dr. Pew-Thian Yap‚Äôs lab at UNC-Chapel Hill, where I build tools to better understand how the brain changes over time ‚Äî through development, aging, and disease. I‚Äôm especially focused on creating normative brain charts, like the height and weight charts used in pediatric care, to help spot when something‚Äôs not quite right.
At the heart of it, I‚Äôm driven by a simple goal - to turn brain scans into practical tools that make healthcare better ‚Äî so no child is left behind just because we didn‚Äôt see the signs soon enough.
#Most of my work is grounded in x-space (where the brain images live), but my mind often drifts into q-space and k-space ‚Äî where the raw signals and deeper patterns begin to emerge.
