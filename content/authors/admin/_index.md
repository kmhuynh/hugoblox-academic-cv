    summary: |
      This was a turning point in my MRI journey. I was fortunate to work with Dr. Loan Vo on MRI clinical study, MR-compatible hardware design, structural, functional, and diffusional MRI analysis. I lived on the JISC mailing list and Dr. Andrew Jahn‚Äôs YouTube [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBDmIhSWfnM). It was chaotic, challenging‚Äîand one of the most fun times I‚Äôve had in research.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a postdoc in radiology at UNC Chapel Hill. Since 2017, I‚Äôve been working with Dr. Pew-Thian Yap on MR reconstruction, signal representation, noise removal, tractography, and microstructure imaging using diffusion MRI data with applications in neurodevelopment.
